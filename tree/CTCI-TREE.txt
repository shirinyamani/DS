Question 1: 
Given a directed graph with two nodes(S,E), design an algorithm to find whether there is a route between S and E
    #hint: BFS / Queue

Question 2:
Given a sorted array with unique integers, write an algorithm to build a BST
with Minimal height!
    #hint: Minimal height ---> left n right heights gotta be equal (mid)
