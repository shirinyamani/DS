Question 1: 
Given a directed graph with two nodes(S,E), design an algorithm to find whether there is a route between S and E
    #hint: BFS / Queue

Question 2:
Given a sorted array with unique integers, write an algorithm to build a BST
with Minimal height!
    #hint: Minimal height ---> left n right heights gotta be equal (mid)
    
Question 3:
Given a BT, design an algorithm to create a linked list of all the nodes at each depth
    #hint: BFS / Queue
    #hint: use a {level: [nodes]} dict

Question4:
Write an algorithm to check whether a tree is balanced!
    #hint: check heights of both left n right and see the difference not
    be greater than 1!
